A personal project of creating a Maya tool to rename multiple elements back in 2022/2023.
Perfect for my character rig that has "too many fingers."
Also a great practice for me to build a UI in Maya so it's easier to navigate and looks prettier. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Simply copy and past the code to a new tab in Maya Script editor.
Select all and middle-mouse-button drag the code to the desired shelf for quick access.
